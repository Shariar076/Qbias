The Details: Trump sent a memorandum to the Secretaries of Defense, Homeland Security, Agriculture, and the Interior, instructing the Department of Defense (DoD) to take control of federal lands near the border. This includes a 60-foot-wide strip of land that spans parts of California, Arizona, and New Mexico, known as the Roosevelt Reservation. The memo gives the Pentagon a green light to build “national defense areas” on the lands, which could effectively function as active-duty military spaces. The memo does not include Federal Indian Reservations.
For Context: The Roosevelt Reservation was designated as federal land by Theodore Roosevelt in 1907 to keep public land on the border “free from obstruction as a protection against the smuggling of goods between the United States and Mexico.” The Secretary of Defense has 45 days to assess this first phase and could expand it at any time.
Key Quote: Trump wrote, “I assigned the Armed Forces of the United States the military missions of repelling the invasion and sealing the United States southern border from unlawful entry to maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the United States.”
How The Media Covered It: Fox News (Right bias) and NewsNation (Center) noted that the Roosevelt Reservation was established to keep the border secure, while CNN (Lean Left) did not. CNN wrote, “The military is prohibited from carrying out domestic law enforcement under the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, but by describing the zone as a ‘holding’ area, DoD could feasibly circumvent that law.”

Kennedy Jr. announced a large-scale research initiative to determine the cause of autism by September, prompting skepticism from some health experts. 
The Details: The “massive testing and research effort” would involve hundreds of scientists to investigate reports of rising autism rates. Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, announced the initiative during a televised White House Cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump. ""By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic, and we'll be able to eliminate those exposures,"" Kennedy said. 
For Context: Trump echoed concerns about rising autism rates, but experts and advocacy groups warned the initiative could hinder scientific progress. Autism, a developmental disability caused by brain differences, can involve delays in language, learning, and social or emotional development.
Key Quotes: In a lengthy statement denouncing the efforts, Autism Society of America President and CEO Christopher Banks expressed concerns regarding “the lack of transparency surrounding this proposed research and looming September deadline —specifically regarding who is leading this research, what methodologies are being used, and whether it will meet established scientific standards.”

In an interview cited by the outlet, Bessent argued that the escalation was a “loser” for Beijing and expressed disappointment that the Chinese were not willing to negotiate.

In an interview cited by the outlet, Bessent argued that the escalation was a “loser” for Beijing and expressed disappointment that the Chinese were not willing to negotiate. USA Today (Lean Left), while also acknowledging the US perspective, placed more emphasis on the global impact, particularly the fears of a global recession and disruptions to supply chains.

Some Forecasters, Firms Disagree","Several prominent figures have predicted a recession this year due to President Donald Trump's tariff policy. How likely is a recession, and what would indicate the US is heading into one? 
Recession Predictions: Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase Jamie Dimon said a recession is a likely outcome of Trump's tariffs. ""I hear it from just everybody now, ‘I'm going to cut back a little bit, I'm gonna wait, see what happens.’ That is kind of recessionary talk,"" he added. Larry Summers, top economic advisor to former President Barack Obama, also predicted a recession. Last Thursday, JP Morgan predicted a 60% chance of a 2025 recession, up from its previous prediction of 40%. On Monday, Goldman Sachs raised its prediction from 35% to 45%. As of Wednesday, betting market start-up Kalshi had the odds of a recession this year at 70%, and Polymarket had it at 65%. 
Anti-Recession: However, others said it's unlikely the US will slip into a recession, including the American Bankers Association, which put the risk at 30%. Economic prediction service Oxford Economics also cast doubt on the chances of a recession. Wells Fargo said, ""[T]he solid underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy should prevent it from slipping into recession this year.""
Indicators: HuffPost (Left bias) cataloged atypical recession indicators from the service industry. It pointed out that strippers and sex workers are often the first to notice signs of a recession based on their earnings. Other indicators included the type of beer people drink, declining sales of men's underwear, increasing sales of lipstick (a cheap luxury that substitutes normally more expensive purchases), increasing brunettes due to the expense of hair upkeep, and falling paid subscriptions to dating apps.

The Details: Anthony's family launched a fundraiser on the platform GiveSendGo, labeling the “narrative being spread” as “false, unjust, and harmful.” As of early April 10, they’ve raised over $350,000 of a $450,000 goal. The goal was previously set at $100,000, $150,000, $200,000, $300,000, and $350,000. Metcalf's family has also established a fundraiser for their expenses via GoFundMe, raising over $325,000 since April 2. Metcalf's family has also extended its fundraising goal several times to where it currently sits at $330,000.
For Context: The altercation between Metcalf and Anthony allegedly began after Metcalf told Anthony he was sitting in the wrong seat. Things then escalated physically – after Metcalf allegedly put his hands on Anthony – and resulted in the stabbing, all of which “really was under 30 seconds,” according to Metcalf’s twin brother. Anthony’s attorney said Anthony told him he acted in “self-defense.”
How The Media Covered It: Several mainstream outlets covered the fundraiser and its progress over the weekend, with most totals reflected in headlines being outdated by early on April 7.

The administration aims to coordinate any action against the cartels with Mexico's military and law enforcement agencies, but unilateral action without Mexico's consent has not been ruled out.
For Context: The Trump administration has already been shifting military, intelligence, and law enforcement resources towards combating the cartels. In February, the US designated the Sinaloa Cartel and other Mexican drug cartels as global terrorist organizations, an action that some analysts believe could be a stepping stone for military action.
Key Quotes: A former official familiar with the administration's plans told NBC News (Lean Left bias) that the administration is “looking to build a target deck,” which could include individual cartel operatives, vehicles, warehouses, and other components of the cartels’ infrastructure.
How the Media Covered It: Townhall (Right) appeared to support the idea of drone strikes, highlighting the Trump administration's efforts to combat the drug cartels. Associated Press (Left) emphasized that the US military does not currently have the authority to carry out drone strikes on drug cartels in Mexico, according to a top Pentagon official. Reuters (Center) reported that Mexico would reject any unilateral US military action, with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stating that such action ""would not resolve anything.""

The Details: The orders seek to “end the government bias against coal” and “turbo charge coal mining in America” by slashing regulations that target coal, rapidly expediting leases for coal mining on federal lands, and streamlining the permitting process. Additionally, Trump instructed the Department of Justice to stop the enforcement of state climate laws that his administration considers unconstitutional or unenforceable.
For Context: The Biden administration put restrictions on the coal industry due to environmental concerns. The industry has been greatly affected by the increased push towards clean energy. The Trump administration seeks to restore the coal industry, arguing that coal is abundant, cost-effective, and essential for meeting the rise in electricity demand. In 2024, renewables provided a record 32% of global electricity.

According to US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, 50 countries have reached out to “explore how to achieve reciprocity.”
The Details: Trump has stated that if “fair deals” and “good deals” can be made with foreign countries, he will be open to reaching agreements to lower the imposed tariffs. The White House is starting by focusing on non-tariff related measures that they say impede US exports. However, these negotiations are unlikely to take place before the tariffs take effect.
For Context: Trump said he is looking for tailor-made deals with each country. So far, negotiations have started with South Korea and Israel, and Trump instructed his team to begin talks with Japan. Vietnam, Cambodia, Bangladesh, and the European Union have reached out with their own offers, and other countries expressed interest in diplomacy, including India, Indonesia, and the UK. 
How The Media Covered It: Fox Business (Lean Right) quoted representatives of various countries, emphasizing that they want to negotiate with the US. CNN Business (Lean Left) quoted Greer and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), who said tariffs are “clobbering American families and small businesses.” It added that Greer “also pointed to the prominent role that so-called non-trade barriers are playing in Trump’s trade policy, one of them being foreign countries’ regulations rooted in 'fake science.'”

Fox News (Right) ran an exclusive on the finalized deal, saying, “The Trump administration filed a memorandum of understanding [MOU] late Monday with a court to create guardrails and a process for ICE requests to the IRS to further investigations of criminal illegal immigrants who have failed or refuse to leave the United States 90 days after a judge has issued a final order of removal.” The Post added that “IRS officials were aghast” and “It would be highly unusual, and perhaps illegal, the people said, to use tax data to enact criminal penalties. IRS executives told Homeland Security officials that their request probably violates the narrow criminal investigation exemptions.”
Criminal Investigation Exemptions: Some IRS officials argued that criminal exemptions are meant for criminal investigations, not for unauthorized immigration enforcement, a civil offense. The MOU argues that the privacy of law-abiding taxpayers will still be protected while the IRS assists law enforcement, which is their obligation according to the exemption, adding that the immigrants were given due process when they overstayed a judge's 90-day removal order.

Key Details: Colossal Biosciences extracted and sequenced the genomes of dire wolves from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull, and then made 14 key edits in the genomes of gray wolves to match those of the dire wolves. The edited cells were inserted into dog eggs, which were then implanted into surrogate mother dogs. The result was the birth of three dire wolf pups, named Romulus, Remus, and Khaleesi. The company has plans to bring back other extinct species such as the woolly mammoth, the dodo, and the Tasmanian wolf.
Key Quote: ""We are an evolutionary force at this point,"" says Beth Shapiro, Colossal’s chief science officer, speaking of humanity as a whole. “We are deciding what the future of these species will be.”
For Context: Dire wolves, which weighed around 150 pounds and were about twice the size of today's gray wolves, last roamed North and South America around 12,000 years ago. They went extinct at the end of the last Ice Age.

Reason (Center bias) focused on the scientific process and the potential it holds for reviving other extinct species. Time Magazine (Lean Left bias) provided a more detailed exploration of the ethical implications of using genetic engineering to prevent existing species from becoming extinct.

The Details: Trump stated that his administration will hold direct talks with Iran on Saturday. The conversation, deemed to be ""at almost the highest level,"" is hoped to result in a deal to avoid military alternatives. The surprise announcement followed Trump's repeated warnings to Iran for a new nuclear deal. Tehran has yet to confirm the talks.

However, the New York Post (Lean Right bias) focused more on the details of the meeting while connecting President Joe Biden’s decision to end Trump's ""maximum pressure"" campaign to the current state of affairs. Meanwhile, Axios (Lean Left) highlighted Netanyahu's skepticism about the likelihood of a US-Iran deal and his alleged preference for the ""Libya model,"" which calls for the full dismantling of Iran's nuclear program.

The Details: Trump stated that his administration will hold direct talks with Iran on Saturday. The conversation, deemed to be ""at almost the highest level,"" is hoped to result in a deal to avoid military alternatives. The surprise announcement followed Trump's repeated warnings to Iran for a new nuclear deal. Tehran has yet to confirm the talks. Netanyahu's visit also featured discussions on the ongoing war in Gaza, with Trump expressing his wish for the conflict to end soon and all hostages to be released. In addition, Netanyahu committed to working towards eliminating trade deficits in the US.
For Context: The Trump administration has been enforcing economic sanctions against Iran since February, reinstating the ""maximum pressure"" policy of Trump’s first term. Trump's call for a new nuclear deal with Iran follows his criticism of the previous deal made under President Barack Obama's term, which he claimed did little to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, the war in Gaza has resulted in significant casualties and hostage situations, sparking global concerns.

Fans Don’t Care: A report from Ethan Sears of The New York Post (Lean Right) included an analysis of the National Hockey League and Ovechkin’s politics at the end. Sears wrote, “With the league throwing its resources into celebrating Ovechkin, it seems clear that the superstar’s popularity has not been dented by his support of Russian president Vladimir Putin.” He described Putin as a “dictator” that Ovechkin publicly supports, but despite it, Ovechkin received a “loud celebration” on Sunday and “everyone got what they came to see.”

He is being held at a notorious prison in El Salvador, despite having a protected legal status. 
The Details: Abrego-Garcia's attorneys had previously filed a lawsuit requesting that the El Salvador government return him to the US, saying he has no affiliation to Tren de Aragua, MS-13, or any other criminal gang. Since he is no longer in US custody, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argued the court cannot order his return to the US. 
For Context: Abrego-Garcia came to the US in 2011 from El Salvador. In 2019, a confidential informant alleged Abrego-Garcia was a member of MS-13. However, when he applied for withholding of removal later that year, a judge granted it. Vice President JD Vance falsely referred to Abergo-Garcia as a “convicted MS-13 gang member.” ICE said they were aware of his protection from removal, but he was still deported due to an “administrative error.”
How The Media Covered It: The story was predominately covered on the left and center. Several outlets emphasized that Abrego-Garcia is a father. NBC News (Lean Left bias) added, “After finishing his shift as a sheet metal worker and picking up his child, Garcia was pulled over and arrested by Homeland Security agents…ICE officers allegedly told him that his wife had to collect the couple's child within 10 minutes or he would be handed over to Child Protective Services… She arrived and found Garcia 'confused, distraught and crying,' but she received no explanation for his arrest, the filing says.” Updated 4/7/25 to specify that Abrego Garcia applied for withholding of removal, rather than asylum.

122,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy73gqq64do,"April 4th, 2025","Maryland Man Wrongly Deported to El Salvador Prison, Judge Orders Return to the US","A federal judge ruled to return a Maryland man, Kilmer Armado Abrego-Garcia, back to the US after US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) admitted an “administrative error” led to his deportation. He is being held at a notorious prison in El Salvador, despite having a protected legal status. 
The Details: Abrego-Garcia's attorneys had previously filed a lawsuit requesting that the El Salvador government return him to the US, saying he has no affiliation to Tren de Aragua, MS-13, or any other criminal gang. Since he is no longer in US custody, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argued the court cannot order his return to the US. 
For Context: Abrego-Garcia came to the US in 2011 from El Salvador. In 2019, a confidential informant alleged Abrego-Garcia was a member of MS-13. However, when he applied for withholding of removal later that year, a judge granted it. Vice President JD Vance falsely referred to Abergo-Garcia as a “convicted MS-13 gang member.” ICE said they were aware of his protection from removal, but he was still deported due to an “administrative error.”
How The Media Covered It: The story was predominately covered on the left and center. Several outlets emphasized that Abrego-Garcia is a father. NBC News (Lean Left bias) added, “After finishing his shift as a sheet metal worker and picking up his child, Garcia was pulled over and arrested by Homeland Security agents…ICE officers allegedly told him that his wife had to collect the couple's child within 10 minutes or he would be handed over to Child Protective Services… She arrived and found Garcia 'confused, distraught and crying,' but she received no explanation for his arrest, the filing says.” Updated 4/7/25 to specify that Abrego Garcia applied for withholding of removal, rather than asylum.

The Details: The new double-digit tariff is a direct retaliation to Trump's 34% tariff on Chinese exports, including a 20% levy earlier this year. As part of its retaliatory measures, China has imposed stricter export controls on certain key rare materials used in high-tech products. This includes seven rare earth elements, which are critical for manufacturing computer chips and electric vehicle batteries. China also announced two trade investigations into American exports of medical imaging equipment, a sector where the US remains internationally competitive.
For Context: China's retaliatory measures are seen as a signal that it will not back down in the face of Trump's trade policies. The trade war also disrupted the stock market, leading to the biggest one-day drop since 2020, sparking debate over whether the tariffs will be beneficial for the US economy in the long run.
How The Media Covered It: The New York Times (Lean Left bias) suggested China's response shows it has no intention of backing down in the face of Trump's aggressive trade policies, noting China's retaliatory tariffs will hit fewer goods than Trump’s tariffs because China sells far more to the US than it buys. The Washington Post (Lean Left) looked at how China is seeking to extend its global influence in the upheaval of Trump's tariffs by offering 'trauma bonding' with US partners, reporting that China has been courting US allies who are stunned and disappointed by the US tariff hikes.

Reuters (Center) cited investors “bracing for the increasing chance” of recession, but it also included a quote from Trump saying, “I think it’s going very well.” Newsmax (Right) focused on the Trump administration’s confidence in the long-term benefits of the tariffs, with a headline stating J.D. Vance is “'Feeling Good' About Tariffs Despite Bad Day.”

Voices across the spectrum rallied against the tariffs, though a few on the right supported them.
From the Left: Voices on the left were uniformly against the tariffs, noting that they would hurt the economy and consumers and that Trump's strategy wasn't clear.
From the Right: Many voices on the right argued that Trump's tariffs are more than risky and could lead to a recession. However, a piece in Newsmax (Right bias) argued for reciprocal tariffs, saying, “While patiently waiting decades for some supernatural globalist wand to perform its economic magic, the only thing we really see is once productive, and proud Americans pleading with bureaucrats at the welfare line.”
From the Libertarians: On the left, some commentators seemed baffled by Trump's strategy, while on the right, commentators were more likely to understand his “short-term pain for long-term gain” approach, just disagreeing with it. In libertarian magazine Reason (Center), a writer noted that the confusion could be because Trump's words don't match his actions. Trump says tariffs will make us wealthy, but has a history of backing off if other countries comply with his demands. “If tariffs are the key to tremendous wealth, shouldn't Trump implement them no matter what the leaders of any other countries do or say? If we really can tax our way to prosperity, as Trump claims, why wouldn't we do that? Perhaps it is because we can't, and those claims are lies,” he explained.

The Details: Over a decade, from 2004 to 2016, Le Pen's party is alleged to have operated a scheme to embezzle public funds by creating fictitious parliamentary assistant positions at the European Parliament. The guilty verdict resulted in banning Le Pen from running for office, effective immediately and spanning five years, preventing Le Pen from running for president in 2027. Many have drawn comparisons between the RN's response to this verdict and Trump's reaction to his legal challenges, particularly his conviction over a criminal hush-money scheme during the 2016 election.
For Context: Le Pen’s party, originally named the Front National until 2018, is known for its right-wing reactionary stance. Her sentence comes under a French anti-corruption law passed in 2016, which stipulates ineligibility to run for office in the event of a guilty verdict. Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's likely successor, has mirrored Trump's rhetoric in declaring that French democracy has been “killed” due to the verdict.
How the Media Covered It: A writer for The Guardian (Left bias) commended the French justice system for its courage in upholding the law without giving special treatment to powerful figures like Le Pen. The author suggested that France’s stance could serve as a model for other nations battling corruption in political leadership. On the other hand, Rich Lowry (Right), writing for National Review (Right), took a different approach, focusing on the parallels between Le Pen's situation and the legal challenges faced by Trump. The piece, titled ""This Is What They Wanted to Do to Trump"", framed the legal actions against both figures as a form of political persecution.

The Details: The task force will work with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to crack down on the attacks. Its creation comes after a surge of attacks - one just hours before in Austin, Texas, where a bomb squad found several incendiary devices at a Tesla showroom. There have been at least 80 reported cases of arson or vandalism of Tesla vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, as well as a number of peaceful demonstrations at Tesla showrooms. A group called “Tesla Takedown” is calling for protests on Saturday, March 29 outside Tesla showrooms across America.
Key Quote: ""This is domestic terrorism,"" FBI Director Kash Patel said. ""Those responsible will be pursued, caught, and brought to justice.""
For Context: The recent attacks have coincided with CEO Elon Muk's increased role in the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). On March 12, President Donald Trump showed his support for Musk by purchasing a Tesla at the White House while calling out the violence against the dealerships. Last week, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick drew criticism when he recommended the public “buy Tesla” stock.

Toczylowski said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) wrongly detained Cedeno-Gil last year when he sought asylum in the U.S. over tattoos it thought linked him to the street gang Tren de Aragua, but she claimed were “normal.” He allegedly sought asylum because he is gay and is opposed to the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
For Context: Around March 16, the Trump administration deported over 200 Venezuelans to a “mega” prison in El Salvador, claiming suspicions of links to Tren de Aragua.

A federal judge immediately ordered Trump to halt the deportations, and media across the spectrum questioned if Trump’s action was legal or not.

The comment has raised concerns over potential ethical violations, as federal law prohibits government officials from endorsing private companies for personal gain.
The Details: During a TV appearance, Lutnick stated, “It will never be this cheap. Buy Tesla,” shortly after former President Donald Trump showcased Tesla vehicles on the White House lawn. Following the comments, Tesla stock dipped and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee ranking member Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) called for an investigation into whether Lutnick broke the law.
For Context: The law prohibiting federal employees from using public office “for private gain” has been in place since 1989. It bars endorsing products, services, or companies, particularly when the official's position could lend weight to the recommendation. While presidents are generally exempt from federal ethics laws, cabinet officials like Lutnick are not.
How The Media Covered It: Both Associated Press (Left bias) and Fox News (Right) noted that most ethics experts agreed Lutnick broke the law, but that he may not be formally investigated for his comments as the head of the Office of Government Ethics was recently fired by President Donald Trump. MarketWatch (Center) focused on the growing political polarization moving into the stock market, noting that Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) said to sell Tesla while the White House appeared to prop up Tesla.

‘Feminist Rant’: Don Feder of The Washington Times (Lean Right bias) said Disney turned the 1937 classic film into “a feminist rant” and that Zegler “spouts the most awful drivel” to the press about the film’s feminist themes. Feder highlighted what he deems the “toxic dogma” of feminism, citing statistics around “isolation, plummeting birth rates, and children set adrift” and added, “Movies reflect the culture.”
‘Lefty Infighting’: Alison Willmore of New York Magazine (Left) argued Zegler was “set up” to fail by Disney and that the film is a paradigm for “lefty infighting.” Willmore described Snow White as “an institutionalist… pining for the idealized era of Obama’s/her father’s leadership.” “It’s a tale as old as time,” added Willmore “A sheltered Ivy League girl meets a rakish dirtbag leftist who lives with a bunch of roommates and who radicalizes her by negging her about her privilege.” Willmore concluded that the movie is a “joke” and described Disney as “a corporation that has for years been lumbering after its idea of the Zeitgeist with all the agility of an aging colossus.”
Watered Down, Twice: Poppy Sowerby of UnHerd (Center) compared Disney’s live-action to its adaptation of the original Snow White fairytale published by the German Brothers Grimm in 1812 into the classic animated film in 1937. Sowerby wrote that in the 1930s, Disney removed the original tale’s “more gruesome and confusing elements” to better fit “the contemporary moral mold of antebellum America.” Of the 2025 version, she claimed it was a “similar process” that involved “shoehorning modern manners into this unruly fairy tale.”
Positive Review: Owen Gleiberman of Variety (Left) argued that “the controversies are bupkis,” and the film is “more frolicsome and less lead-footed than most of the Disney cartoon remakes, with just enough of a love story to get by.” Gleiberman said the surrounding controversies exist “in a rare moment of ideological combustibility… from both sides of the cultural-politics spectrum,” and that Disney making Snow White “this pointedly political” was a surprise.

The Details: The move is aimed at reducing the United States' dependence on imports, especially from countries like China. The executive order directs government agencies, including the Defense Department, to prioritize mining projects and provide technical and financial support to boost critical mineral production. 
For Context: The U.S. is largely reliant on China and other countries for minerals, with 100% import dependence on 15 critical minerals and specifically 50% reliance on China for some of these minerals, according to the order.
How the Media Covered It: BBC News (Center bias) included quotes from the order saying “It is imperative for our national security that the United States take immediate action to facilitate domestic mineral production” and that the US is working on striking deals with other countries such as Ukraine. CNN (Lean Left) emphasized China's dominance over critical mineral exports.

Kennedy are letters written by a man who claimed he warned an American official in Bulgaria that Lee Harvey Oswald would assassinate Kennedy three months before it happened. There's no hard evidence that he did, but there was enough detail in the files about his claims to spark widespread speculation online.
American Warning: Sergyj Czornonoh, an apparent U.S. citizen living in Sacramento at the time, wrote letters in 1978 to a Sacramento district attorney and Russian and British ambassadors in D.C. In them, he claimed an official named Vasilev working at the Soviet embassy in Bulgaria instructed him in August 1963 to tell the U.S. government that Oswald would kill Kennedy. Czornonoh said he told American Vice Consul Blackshire at Sofia airport on August 15. 
British Warning: In the 1978 letters, Czornonoh claimed he also warned a British immigration officer, who apprehended him in London in July 1963. Czornonoh was asking the British embassy “to help to find the truth” and forward the record of his claim to then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter.
For Context: Lee Harvey Oswald defected to the Soviet Union in 1959 before moving back to the U.S. in 1961 with a wife whose uncle was a colonel in the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs. The recent document dump also included a U.S. intelligence report that said the KGB watched Oswald “closely and constantly while he was in the U.S.S.R.”
Other Key Claims: In his letter to the Sacramento district attorney, Czornonoh alleged the FBI, which he described as “right wing,” harassed and tortured him in 1976, attempting to get him to assassinate Democratic Presidential candidate and former Kennedy administration official Sargent Shriver.
How The Media Covered It: Czornonoh’s letters were not widely covered by mainstream outlets, but The Washington Times (Lean Right bias), Daily Mail (Right), The Independent (Lean Left), and The Sun (Center) covered them. There was significant dialogue surrounding the letters on X.

The Details: There have been peaceful protests at Tesla dealerships and factories across the US, but there have also been several cases of vandalism to Tesla cars and dealerships. In some cases, hackers have released the names and addresses of Tesla owners. Musk said, “My companies make great products that people love and I’ve never physically hurt anyone.

From the Right: A writer in ZeroHedge (Lean Right bias) said that “the level of hate, misinformation, and knee-jerk negativity directed at him has gone far beyond reason,” dubbing it 'Musk Derangement Syndrome.' Gus Carlson (Lean Right) in The Globe and Mail (Center) called hate for Musk “hypocritical and childish” adding that voters gave President Donald Trump a mandate and that Musk is a part of the mandate. “Protesters should put away their Molotov cocktails, firearms and cans of spray paint and act like constructive members of a democracy,” he concluded. 
From the Left: A piece in The New Republic (Left) characterized Musk as “whining” and “playing the victim” adding that “the world’s richest man thinks it’s unfair that people aren’t as interested in his products due to his far-right political views.” It also referred to him as the “Sieg heil!–waving billionaire.”

Was the Experiment Legit?,"Popular YouTuber and former NASA engineer Mark Rober released a video that showed a self-driving Tesla car drive itself through a wall painted to look like a road, splitting mainstream media on the verity of the experiment.
The Details: In the video, which promotes Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology and Rober's company that sells products that use it, Rober tests LiDAR technology at Disney World to map its Space Mountain ride and then in a self-driving car by the company Luminar. Rober tests Elon Musk’s Tesla car, which is equipped with cameras, against Luminar’s LiDAR-equipped car in six trials that gauge the car’s ability to stop in different circumstances. Rober said he was not paid by Luminar.
‘Wile E. Coyote Wall’: In the final trial, Rober measures the car’s ability to stop itself from driving through a “Wile E. Coyote” style wall, that is painted to look like a road. The Tesla – which lost six to three – drove through the wall, while the LiDAR-equipped car stopped before hitting it.
Mainstream Media Coverage: Several mainstream outlets covered Rober’s findings at face value, including Newsweek (Center bias), The Verge (Lean Left), and Business Insider (Lean Left), framing the experiment as a failure for Tesla.
Mainstream Pushback: Other mainstream outlets have published critical coverage. An opinion published in Forbes (Center) said Rober’s effort is “almost entirely wasted” because “he uses an un-named version of Tesla’s ‘Autopilot’ system, which is its older freeway driver-assist tool.” The New York Post (Lean Right) highlighted online criticisms of Rober that noted inconsistencies in his video, such as claiming he’s using a Google Pixel to film, though it appears to be an iPhone, and that later published “raw footage” showed different speeds of the car, meaning Rober could have conducted multiple takes of the test. Bloomberg (Lean Left) noted that Luminar’s stock “soared” 29% immediately following Rober’s video.

‘Wile E. Coyote Wall’: In the final trial, Rober measures the car’s ability to stop itself from driving through a “Wile E. Coyote” style wall, that is painted to look like a road. The Tesla – which lost six to three – drove through the wall, while the LiDAR-equipped car stopped before hitting it.
Mainstream Media Coverage: Several mainstream outlets covered Rober’s findings at face value, including Newsweek (Center bias), The Verge (Lean Left), and Business Insider (Lean Left), framing the experiment as a failure for Tesla.
Mainstream Pushback: Other mainstream outlets have published critical coverage. An opinion published in Forbes (Center) said Rober’s effort is “almost entirely wasted” because “he uses an un-named version of Tesla’s ‘Autopilot’ system, which is its older freeway driver-assist tool.” The New York Post (Lean Right) highlighted online criticisms of Rober that noted inconsistencies in his video, such as claiming he’s using a Google Pixel to film, though it appears to be an iPhone, and that later published “raw footage” showed different speeds of the car, meaning Rober could have conducted multiple takes of the test. Bloomberg (Lean Left) noted that Luminar’s stock “soared” 29% immediately following Rober’s video.

Kennedy were released on Tuesday, fulfilling a campaign promise from President Donald Trump to declassify the documents.
The Details: In January, Trump signed an executive order to declassify government files regarding the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr.
Key Quote: While touring the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Monday, Trump said, “While we’re here, I thought it would be appropriate — we are, tomorrow, announcing and giving all of the Kennedy files. So, people have been waiting for decades for this, and I’ve instructed my people … lots of different people, [Director of National Intelligence] Tulsi Gabbard, that they must be released tomorrow.""
For Context: In 1992, Congress enacted the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, which required the National Archives to keep and publicly release all assassination-related material in a single collection. The FBI discovered about 2,400 records now recognized as related to the assassination last month. Currently, about 97% of the records are available to the public, according to the National Archives.
How the Media Covered It: Sources across the political spectrum reported that the assassination of Kennedy in November 1963 has remained a point of public interest for decades. This interest has led to many theories about the involvement of the CIA or the existence of multiple shooters.

AP highlighted the death toll in its headline and used sensational language, saying the ceasefire was “shattered” by Israel. AP also included some details that appealed to emotion, such as a report that a strike on Rafah “killed 17 members of one family, including at least 12 women and children,” and that its reporters in Gaza “saw explosions and plumes of smoke.” Fox highlighted the “terror” and “terrorist” threats posed by Hamas while AP didn’t use either word in its coverage.

The Details: Williams and Wilmore, who had been in space since June 2024, were initially only supposed to have a short stay on the International Space Station. However, they encountered thruster issues following the launch of Boeing’s Starliner mission last year. The Starliner returned to Earth last September without its crew. The two astronauts, joined by NASA's Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, undocked from the International Space Station early Tuesday and are set to splash down in Florida late Tuesday.
For Context: The astronauts' prolonged stay in space gained international attention and became a politically charged issue. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said he could have brought Williams and Wilmore home months ago, but the offer was denied by the Biden administration for “political reasons.” Senior Biden officials told CNN (Lean Left bias) they weren't aware of any offer. 
How The Media Covered It: Fox Business (Lean Right) and Breitbart (Right) highlighted President Trump's involvement in the situation, quoting him, and noting President Biden's failure to bring the astronauts back.

From the Left: A writer for Vox (Left bias) argued, “The plaintiffs’ attorneys cite publicly available flight data as well as news reports, which suggest that the Trump administration allowed these planes to land and discharge their passengers after Boasberg issued his order.

The Details: The Alien Enemies Act, passed in 1798, was last invoked during World War II. It grants the president sweeping powers to order the detention and deportation of citizens or natives of an ""enemy"" nation without following the usual processes. So far, of the 261 Venezuelans deported to a mega jail in El Salvador, 137 were removed under the Alien Enemies Act. The move has sparked criticism from human rights groups.
For Context: This is the first time Trump has used this act, although he has mentioned it in the past. In his inaugural address, he stated he would use the act to ""eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil.""
How the Media Covered It: Fox News (Right bias) highlighted Trump's commitment to eliminating criminal networks causing devastation on U.S. soil. Associated Press (Lean Left) wrote that the argument over whether ""illegal immigration constitute(s) an invasion"" is an ""untested"" one, and noted that a federal judge halted the order for deportations hours later.

The Details: Per ""officials familiar with the matter"" cited by the New York Times (Lean Left bias), the ban is divided into three lists: red, orange, and yellow. The red list includes 11 countries whose citizens may face a total ban: Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen. The other two lists may face visa restrictions pending reviews. In a slightly different report, Reuters (Center) said travel from 41 countries would be banned or restricted, citing anonymous sources and an ""internal memo."" 
For Context: In Trump's first term, he banned travel from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The move was met with legal challenges but ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court. It was later revoked under the Biden administration. Upon reentering the Oval Office, Trump issued an executive order that required intensified security vetting of any foreigners seeking admission to the U.S. The State Department was given 60 days to report a list of countries which had deficient vetting and screening information of citizens to the White House.

The Details: The ED laid off more than 1,300 workers from its original staff of around 3,500. Divisions affected by the layoffs included the Office of Civil Rights, which enforces civil rights laws and investigates discrimination; the Federal Student Aid division, which manages student loans; and the Institute of Education Sciences, which researches teaching practices and education efficacy. 
For Context: Trump was expected to sign an Executive Order shutting down the ED last week, which National Review News (Lean Right bias) says was delayed “seemingly because of concerns of blowback against the administration.”
How the Media Covered It: National Review emphasized how these layoffs reduce government spending, highlighting that DOGE also “cancelled several Education Department contracts amounting to millions of dollars.” AP (Left) quoted several anonymous staffers from the department speaking about the already overwhelming workload and wrote that the Trump administration “has not said how it will proceed with thousands of cases being handled by staff it’s eliminating.” These cases involve racial and religious discrimination, disability services, and complaints of sexual violence on campuses. The Hill (Center) focused on Education Secretary Linda McMahon’s statements in a variety of interviews, including her statement that Trump is “taking the bureaucracy out of education so that more money flows to the states. Better education is closest to the kids, with parents, with local superintendents, with local school boards.”

The Details: The ED laid off more than 1,300 workers from its original staff of around 3,500. Divisions affected by the layoffs included the Office of Civil Rights, which enforces civil rights laws and investigates discrimination; the Federal Student Aid division, which manages student loans; and the Institute of Education Sciences, which researches teaching practices and education efficacy. 
For Context: Trump was expected to sign an Executive Order shutting down the ED last week, which National Review News (Lean Right bias) says was delayed “seemingly because of concerns of blowback against the administration.”
How the Media Covered It: National Review emphasized how these layoffs reduce government spending, highlighting that DOGE also “cancelled several Education Department contracts amounting to millions of dollars.” AP (Left) quoted several anonymous staffers from the department speaking about the already overwhelming workload and wrote that the Trump administration “has not said how it will proceed with thousands of cases being handled by staff it’s eliminating.” These cases involve racial and religious discrimination, disability services, and complaints of sexual violence on campuses. The Hill (Center) focused on Education Secretary Linda McMahon’s statements in a variety of interviews, including her statement that Trump is “taking the bureaucracy out of education so that more money flows to the states. Better education is closest to the kids, with parents, with local superintendents, with local school boards.”

The Details: The reduction was more than economists anticipated. Certain groceries increased faster than the overall inflation rate, including beef, biscuits, and apples. Prices for tomatoes, cereal, cupcakes, and cookies dropped over the past year. Egg prices increased 58.8% in February compared to a year ago, accelerating 10.4% from January. Housing cost increases accounted for nearly half of the price increases last month, balanced by a decline in the price of airline tickets and gasoline.

For Context: The stock market has seen significant drops since President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China last week, leading to warnings about a potential economic downturn. The tariffs are widely expected to raise some prices for consumers, as importers typically pass on a portion of the additional cost to shoppers. 
How The Media Covered It: Fox Business (Lean Right bias) focused on the slight decrease in inflation, framing it as a positive development ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting.

For Context: Tesla stock tumbled 15% earler this week as experts lowered their projections for Tesla deliveries. The stock has fallen more than 50% since December.
How the Media Covered It: Some sources on the left framed Trump as using executive influence to help Tesla's business, positioning it as unethical. Some sources on the right noted that Musk admitted that he had ""great difficulty"" in balancing his businesses with his advisory role in the White House.

Responding to Ontario's electricity price hike, Trump doubled tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel. Then, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he was suspending the province’s 25% surtax following a conversation with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, saying Lutnick offered an olive branch, promting Trump to also back off his 50% metal tariff. 
The Details: Ontario Premier Doug Ford originally ordered an implementation of a $7-per-megawatt-per-hour fee on all power exports to the three states. “Believe me when I say I don’t want to do this. I feel terrible for the American people,” Ford said. “It’s one person who is responsible. That’s President Donald Trump.” Ford said that the charge would stay in place despite Trump's one-month reprieve from tariffs, noting it only added uncertainty. 
For Context: Trump's tariffs, which went into effect on March 4, taxed imports from Canada and Mexico at 25% but exempted cars and USMCA-compliant goods until April. Canadian energy products were subject to 10% import duties. Canadian electricity is sold to 1.5 million Americans. 
How The Media Covered It: The Star Tribune (Lean Left) reported that the tax was expected to have little to no impact on Minnesota or the bills of its electric customers, as Minnesota's biggest utilities use little power from Ontario. It also noted Gov. Tim Walz's criticism of Trump's escalating trade war. The New York Post (Lean Right) noted the limited effects for US consumers given our modest Canadian imports, saying “price increase sends a political message.”

For Context: Trump's tariffs, which went into effect on March 4, taxed imports from Canada and Mexico at 25% but exempted cars and USMCA-compliant goods until April. Canadian energy products were subject to 10% import duties. Canadian electricity is sold to 1.5 million Americans. 
How The Media Covered It: The Star Tribune (Lean Left) reported that the tax was expected to have little to no impact on Minnesota or the bills of its electric customers, as Minnesota's biggest utilities use little power from Ontario. It also noted Gov. Tim Walz's criticism of Trump's escalating trade war. The New York Post (Lean Right) noted the limited effects for US consumers given our modest Canadian imports, saying “price increase sends a political message.”

The ban permits abortions in cases of rape, incest, and life-threatening danger to the mother, but not in the event of non-life-threatening health issues.
Discrimination: Cases against Elon Musk’s SpaceX and several fire and police departments are expected to be dropped after accusations of workplace discrimination. This move comes in the midst of calls for Trump to pardon Derek Chauvin, the former police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd. Trump said on Friday that he hadn’t heard about the calls.
Other Lawsuits: The Trump administration dropped a lawsuit that aimed to reduce chloroprene emissions from Denka Performance Elastomer in Louisiana. The lawsuit stated that “Denka emits chloroprene at levels that are producing unacceptably high risks of cancer.” Another lawsuit against Dr. Eithan Haim was dropped after the alleged whistleblower faced legal repercussions for reportedly exposing unregulated transgender procedures.

The Details: The decision came after a six-week review of the programs, which Rubio described as antithetical to the core interests of the United States. The cancellation included 5,200 USAID contracts. The remaining 18% of the programs, approximately 1,000, will be administered under the State Department.

How The Media Covered It: Breitbart (Right bias) highlighted the questionable expenditures of the programs, citing examples such as the promotion of gender transition procedures in Guatemala and the creation of work opportunities for young LGBTQ people in Serbia. The outlet also underscored USAID's failure to curb drug cartels in Mexico despite the infusion of $3 billion US tax dollars since 2008.

The Details: The plans come after Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called for a push “ensuring that accurate information about vaccine safety and efficacy is disseminated.” He did not oppose vaccines but did stress individualized decision-making. Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the National Institutes of Health (NIH), said he doesn’t “generally believe” in a link between autism and vaccines but “would support a broad scientific agenda, based on data” to get concrete answers.
For Context: Amidst a decline in US childhood vaccination rates, a measles outbreak has spread in the south, mainly throughout Texas. Kennedy faced criticism for his response in saying outbreaks occur yearly and are “not unusual.” Kennedy has long been skeptical of vaccines and “Big Pharma.” A potential link between vaccines and autism is one of many existing theories about the increase in autism diagnoses. Many believe the increase is merely due to increased and broadened screenings, though an official cause remains unclear.
How the Media Covered It: USA Today (Lean Left bias) and Newsmax (Right) shared some common ground in stating that Kennedy “downplayed” the measles outbreak. USA Today led its article by stating, “Decades of scientific evidence haven’t found a link between autism and vaccines…” It called vaccines “safe and highly effective” and said people have “falsely been told [vaccines] are dangerous,” only citing sources that oppose Kennedy. Newsweek (Center) also stated, “extensive scientific research [has] consistently found no link between vaccines and autism,” and Newsmax cited an NBC News Digital (Lean Left) piece referring to the theory “already being debunked over the decades.”","['Public Health', 'Big Pharma', 'Robert F Kennedy Jr', 'CDC', 'Autism', 'Vaccine', 'NIH', 'Jay Bhattacharya', 'Vaccine Side Effects', 'Vaccine Skepticism', 'Vaccines', 'Anti-Vaccination', 'HHS']","CDC eyes vaccines, autism study amid measles outbreak, report says. What to know",USA TODAY,"Decades of scientific evidence haven’t found a link between autism and vaccines, but that doesn’t appear to stop the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from reportedly planning to study the issue.
The CDC plans to study potential connections between autism and vaccines, Reuters reported Friday. While it’s unclear whether Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who presides over U.S. health agencies including the CDC, is involved in the large study, Kennedy has long promoted anti-vaccine views and debunked conspiracy theories. USA TODAY has reached out to the CDC for comment.

For Context: Trump signed an executive order aimed at “restoring freedom of speech and ending federal censorship” on his first day in office, but whether he has lived up to his rhetoric is debated. 
Criticism: Critics have pointed to his lawsuits against media operations like the Associated Press (Left bias) and pollster J.

From The Left: David A. Graham of The Atlantic (Left bias) claimed, “The party hasn’t shown much of an ability to unite around its best interests lately,” citing actions taken by party members present at Trump’s address as focal points. Graham mentioned Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin’s speech, some congressional members wearing pink, and signs that said “False,” “Musk Steals,” and “Save Medicaid” as lackluster protests that “felt like a metaphor for their broader messaging struggle.” Graham argued the party should boycott next year’s State of the Union address to send a “stronger and clearer message.”
From The Right: In an opinion for U.S. News & World Report (Lean Left), W. James Antle III (Lean Right) claimed the “Democrats have had no good answer” to Trump and that “their unfocused, directionless opposition to everything the president does ensures that their scattered messages” go unheard. Antle argued the Democrats are waiting for Trump to self-destruct and that it could eventually happen on government efficiency, foreign policy, or tariffs, but that it didn’t during his speech.
Other Coverage Notes: AllSides did not find media coverage that commentated positively on the Democrats’ Tuesday approach.

From The Left: David A. Graham of The Atlantic (Left bias) claimed, “The party hasn’t shown much of an ability to unite around its best interests lately,” citing actions taken by party members present at Trump’s address as focal points. Graham mentioned Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin’s speech, some congressional members wearing pink, and signs that said “False,” “Musk Steals,” and “Save Medicaid” as lackluster protests that “felt like a metaphor for their broader messaging struggle.” Graham argued the party should boycott next year’s State of the Union address to send a “stronger and clearer message.”
From The Right: In an opinion for U.S. News & World Report (Lean Left), W. James Antle III (Lean Right) claimed the “Democrats have had no good answer” to Trump and that “their unfocused, directionless opposition to everything the president does ensures that their scattered messages” go unheard. Antle argued the Democrats are waiting for Trump to self-destruct and that it could eventually happen on government efficiency, foreign policy, or tariffs, but that it didn’t during his speech.
Other Coverage Notes: AllSides did not find media coverage that commentated positively on the Democrats’ Tuesday approach. In addition to U.S. News & World Report, USA Today (Lean Left) and The Hill (Center) also published opinions from authors on the right.

The Details: CK Hutchison Holdings controls the Balboa and Cristobal ports, which are located on each end of the Panama Canal and handled 40% of all cargo shipped through the canal last year. As part of the deal, BlackRock’s consortium will also receive 41 other ports in 22 other countries, including Mexico, Egypt, Australia, the Netherlands, and more.
For Context: About 40% of U.S. container ship traffic runs through the Panama Canal, which was finished being constructed by the U.S. in 1914 but later transferred to Panama by President Jimmy Carter. President Trump previously expressed a desire to control the canal and saying China was “operating” it and that American vessels were being “severely overcharged.” A New York Post (Lean Right bias) report from July 2024 claimed Trump was considering BlackRock CEO Larry Fink for Treasury Secretary.
Key Quotes: In an address to Congress, Trump said, “The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others… We didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we’re taking it back.” CK Hutchison’s Frank Sixt said the transaction “is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports.”
How The Media Covered It: Several outlets, like National Review (Lean Right), Newsweek (Center), and Bloomberg (Lean Left), wrote in headlines that the acquisition was a “win” for Trump.

The Details: Hegseth reportedly issued the orders to Cyber Command chief Gen. Timothy Haugh. Haugh also leads the National Security Agency (NSA), but these orders do not apply to the NSA, as Cyber Command operates under the Department of Defense, and the NSA is an intelligence agency. An anonymous official speaking to Bloomberg (Lean Left bias) denied that Hegseth had canceled or delayed any operations.
For Context: The report followed President Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance’s tense Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Zelensky on Friday. In recent weeks, Trump’s administration has paid increased attention to ending the conflict in Ukraine. Critics have accused Trump of cozying up to Russia.
How The Media Covered It: The news was first reported by The Record (not rated by AllSides) on February 28. The outlet reported speaking to “three people familiar with the matter.” CNN (Lean Left bias) and The New York Times (Lean Left) both reported the news on March 2, citing their own anonymous sources.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Secretary of Health and Human Services, is facing criticism for “downplaying” the outbreak, stating that such outbreaks are “not unusual.” 
The Details: As of Tuesday, the measles outbreak in Texas spread across nine counties, affecting 124 people, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). The outbreak, first confirmed by DSHS on February 5, has also extended to New Mexico, where nine cases have been reported.

Who's Involved: The U.S. recently met with Russia to discuss peace in the region, hosted by Saudi Arabia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was “surprised” they weren't offered a seat at the table and added that he would not accept any deal he wasn't physically present for. Trump's team said Ukraine would be a part of future negotiations, as would the European Union (EU). No future dates for peace talks have been scheduled, but Trump expressed he wants to move fast. 
NATO Membership: Ukraine has repeatedly requested to join NATO, while Russia cited NATO expansion as a reason for its invasion. Some world leaders, such as Sweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, are supportive of Ukraine's bid to join NATO, but the Trump administration opposes the bid. Ukraine may be offered entrance into the EU as a compromise. 
Security Guarantees: Absent NATO membership, Zelensky has suggested Ukraine should be given nuclear weapons and 200,000 foreign troops to safeguard any ceasefire. Trump’s Ukraine peace envoy Keith Kellogg called Ukraine's chance of acquiring nuclear weapons as slim to none. While some have said the West cannot produce 200,000 troops, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his country would commit to an unspecified number of peacekeeping troops. 
Territory: Russia has claimed control over much of the easternmost frontlines, while Ukraine has control over roughly 262 square miles of Russia’s Kursk Oblast. Ukraine has said they will not recognize the eastern land as Russian, but will likely cede control if the fighting ends. The future of Kursk is unclear. Russia said it would not cede the land, but if it cannot expel Ukrainian troops, Ukraine may be able to use the region as leverage.","['Ukraine War', 'Russia', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Volodymyr Zelensky', 'Ukraine', 'Donald Trump', 'Marco Rubio', 'Saudi Arabia', 'NATO', 'European Union', 'EU']",How could the Ukraine war end?

Historical Results: The “far-right” Alternative for Germany (AfD) dominated in former East German states, doubling its results from 2021 with around 21% of the vote nationwide. AfD’s results were the best for a “far-right” party since World War II. Incumbent Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats (SPD) finished third with 16% – their worst result since 1887. Several parties failed to meet the 5% parliament threshold, including the new “far-left” Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) which won 4.97%. 
Coalition Brewing: CDU has said it wants to avoid a three-way coalition. Germany’s main parties have discussed maintaining a “firewall” aimed at stemming “far-right” influence.
For Context: The election was scheduled as a snap in December after Chancellor Scholz’s coalition fell apart in November. AfD and BSW share similar populist anti-immigration platforms and in September achieved historic results in eastern German provinces’ state elections. Members of President Trump’s administration have appeared sympathetic to AfD’s platform over the past month. 
America Relations: Merz, who previously served as a board member at BlackRock, said, “It is clear that the Americans, at least this part of the Americans, this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe,” and that his “absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe” and “achieve independence from the USA.” President Trump celebrated Merz’s win, writing on Truth Social that it is “A GREAT DAY FOR GERMANY, AND FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.”
How The Media Covered It: CNN (Lean Left bias) wrote Merz “has an enormous task ahead” in trying to contain AfD, which it said has “capitalized on” terror attacks carried out by migrants “for its own political gain.” Daily Mail (Right) called the result “disastrous” for Scholz and described Merz as “a brash economic liberal who has shifted the CDU to the right.”","['World', 'Elections', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'European Union', 'Politics']",Merz warns Europe should seek ‘independence’ from US after conservatives win German election - and far-right support surges,CNN Digital,"Europe must seek to “achieve independence” from the United States, Germany’s likely next chancellor Friedrich Merz said after exit polls showed his opposition conservatives were on track to win Sunday’s election, in a vote that also saw surging support for the far-right.

Historical Results: The “far-right” Alternative for Germany (AfD) dominated in former East German states, doubling its results from 2021 with around 21% of the vote nationwide. AfD’s results were the best for a “far-right” party since World War II. Incumbent Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats (SPD) finished third with 16% – their worst result since 1887.

For Context: The election was scheduled as a snap in December after Chancellor Scholz’s coalition fell apart in November.

This comes two weeks after former President Joe Biden also announced he was signing with the agency.
Details: CAA previously represented Harris during her time as California senator. The agency is known for working with high-profile clients across entertainment, media and politics, and also represents several other political figures including Biden and President Barack Obama. Harris has previously authored three books, but no new publishing projects have been announced.
Key Quotes: “CAA will work closely with Harris on her post-White House initiatives, creating strategic opportunities that expand her platform in support of the issues she has championed throughout her decades-long career in public service,” CAA said.
How The Media Covered It: Reports from Fox Business (Lean Right bias) positioned Harris’ public appearances within a broader narrative of political scrutiny, calling her recent speech at the “A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical” a “word salad.” Other coverage from the right framed Harris’s CAA deal with skepticism and humor, implying a shift from public service to self-promotion. USA Today (Lean Left) framed Harris’ signing with CAA as a strategic move to expand her post-White House platform through speaking and publishing opportunities. Other reports also emphasized her previous ties to the agency and CAA’s connections to other prominent Democratic figures.","['Politics', 'Kamala Harris', 'Hollywood', 'Culture']",Kamala Harris signs on with Hollywood talent agency,The Hill,"Former Vice President Kamala Harris is making one of her first post-2024 White House bid moves: signing with Creative Artists Agency (CAA).

Rational Response: This argument hasn’t been prominent in media coverage since Trump’s comment as of this writing, but a minority of media outlets across the spectrum have made the case for it in recent years.","['Ukraine War', 'Ukraine', 'Russia', 'NATO', 'Donald Trump']",The Nato mindset leads to war,UnHerd,"As Nato members and their Asia-Pacific allies convene today to discuss the bloc’s expansion and future strategy, the Ukrainians are destined to be disappointed — insofar as membership is concerned at least.

The Details: The order calls for policy recommendations to “protect IVF access and aggressively reduce out-of-pocket and health plan costs for such treatments.” Trump said at a news conference, “I’ve been saying we’re going to do what we have to do” and that he believes many “women and families [and] husbands are very appreciative of it.” 
For Context: IVF is a medical procedure in which an egg and sperm are combined in a lab, and the embryo is then implanted into the woman to establish a pregnancy. A cycle of IVF typically costs between $15,000 to $25,000 and is rarely covered by insurance. On the campaign trail in August, Trump promised to make IVF free if elected.

The Data: According to CNBC (Center bias), “Filings rose to 1,780 for the week ending Feb. 8, a 36% increase from the prior week and more than four times around the same period in 2024.” There's also been a rise in house listings in Northern Virginia and Maryland. “Falls Church City, Virginia, experienced a 78.6% surge, followed by a 68.8% jump in Fairfax City, a 50.5% increase in Alexandria City, and a 33.5% uptick in Montgomery County, Maryland,” according to ZeroHedge (Lean Right).

The order does not immediately impose the tariffs, but rather directs the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to figure out logistics of the proposed plan. 
For Context: Critics of Trump’s tariff plan argue that the increase in cost from tariffs will likely be passed onto the consumers in the form of higher prices. It still remains unclear how Trump can legally impose this plan, or which countries and goods it will affect more than others. 
Key Quote: ""On trade, I have decided for purposes of fairness, that I will charge a reciprocal tariff — meaning whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them no more, no less. In other words, they charge us a tax or tariff, and we charge them the exact same tax or tariff. Very simple,"" Trump said at the White House.
How The Media Covered It: The Wall Street Journal (Center bias) emphasized that the tariff plan is simply being researched and not immediately imposed, and that if it’s followed through it would “make good on one of Trump’s campaign pledges.” Associated Press (Left) didn’t emphasize that the plan is only being studied and suggested it “could easily backfire.” Fox Business (Lean Right) mentioned a source who said the plan will also investigate and counter nonreciprocal trade. ","['Donald Trump', 'Business', 'Economy And Jobs', 'Foreign Policy', 'Trade']",Trump Orders Federal Agencies to Study Reciprocal Tariffs,Wall Street Journal (News),"WASHINGTON—President Trump on Thursday signed a memo on reciprocal trade, directing federal agencies to study how to adjust U.S. tariff rates to match existing duties and certain economic barriers enforced by other nations.
The order stops short of actually imposing the tariffs immediately, as many foreign capitals feared, and instead directs the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to deliver reports on the steps to be taken to achieve reciprocal trading status. Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick said those studies should be completed by April 1.",center

Then there was a fiery plane crash in Philadelphia, a crash that killed 10 in Alaska, and most recently 1 was killed in a crash in Scottsdale, Arizona in a plane owned by Mötley Crüe frontman Vince Neil. Some have blamed the crashes on the air traffic controller shortage.
The Shortage: As of September 2023, all Valley control towers included in the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) most recent report were short of their 2024 goals set by the air traffic controllers' union and FAA. The staffing shortages have been a longstanding problem, according to Axios (Lean Left). “Air traffic control training is notoriously difficult and an enormous number of people wash out of it,” a Slate (Left) writer added.
How The Media Covered It: While outlets on the left focused on safety and other elements that may have caused the plane crashes. When it came to staffing shortages, voices on the left argued that training is difficult and pushed back on the narrative that DEI lead to shortages. The New York Post cited a lawyer who argued DEI was a factor. “The FAA basically decided the students were too white and the schools too elite, so in 2013 knocked them off the preferred hiring list.” Adding, 95% of previously qualified candidates were screened out after graduating by the FAA's biographical assessment questionnaire, which he said awarded extra points to those with “no aviation experience.” ","['Business', 'FAA', 'Transportation', 'Airplanes', 'Plane Crash', 'Economy And Jobs', 'DEI', 'Airline Safety']",Air traffic controller shortage,Axios,"A huge share of the country's air traffic control facilities are understaffed, per a recent FAA report.

A third frantically tried to fill a prescription after she got a 24-hour notice that her health care was ending,” A New York Times (Lean Left bias) piece began. “Experts and the workers themselves acknowledge that reforms are needed in the federal work force... But experts said that Mr. Musk’s tactics, including offering blanket deferred resignations to two million workers, amounted to an immolation of government without thought or strategy,” it added.
From the Right: A piece in The Federalist (Right bias) argued that federal workers have long been given too much leeway—working shorter hours with more time off and legal protection than the average American and without accountability from voters. “The federal administrative state for decades has been given incredible latitude to pursue its own agenda based on supposed 'expertise,' an expertise that is demonstrably liberal in its political orientation,” it said. 
From the Center: Voices in the center were mixed. A Christian Science Monitor (Center) article said federal workers were grappling with a “demoralizing assault” and the Wall Street Journal (Center) highlighted the once-optimistic business sector worried about the effects the cuts would have on unemployment rates in Washington D.C. especially.

But experts said that Mr. Musk’s tactics, including offering blanket deferred resignations to two million workers, amounted to an immolation of government without thought or strategy,” it added.

From the Center: Voices in the center were mixed. A Christian Science Monitor (Center) article said federal workers were grappling with a “demoralizing assault” and the Wall Street Journal (Center) highlighted the once-optimistic business sector worried about the effects the cuts would have on unemployment rates in Washington D.C. especially.

The Details: On Friday, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols granted a temporary restraining order in response to a last-minute lawsuit filed by two unions against the federal government. The lawsuit argued that USAID workers, including 2,200 who would have been placed on administrative leave, were suffering harm from the government's recent directives and that the Trump administration lacked the authority to take swift action to dismantle the agency. The order will remain in place until Feb. 14.
Court Order: The federal court issued a “limited” temporary restraining order, agreeing with two unions representing USAID workers in the lawsuit. Specifically, Judge Nichols stated that employees “are suffering or will suffer irreparable harm” due to being placed on administrative leave and “the expedited evacuation of USAID employees from their host countries.” 
USAID is the primary U.S. agency providing aid to countries recovering from disasters, overcoming poverty, and pursuing democratic reforms.
For Context: President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk announced plans to shut down the USAID, citing concerns about its efficiency and alleged ties to radical ideologies.

The Details: The ICC had issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes, which Israel has denied. The sanctions led to a majority of the ICC’s member states backing the court, calling it a “a vital pillar of the international justice system.” However, the U.S. and Israel do not recognize the court’s authority. The sanctions may block access to property, assets, and entering the U.S. 
For Context: The ICC is the only global court with powers to charge someone with genocide and war crimes. Trump had previously imposed sanctions on the ICC over investigations into U.S. conduct in Afghanistan, which were later overturned by Biden. Numerous civil rights organizations have claimed Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. 
How The Media Covered It: AP News (Left bias) largely focused on the criticisms against the sanctions from civil rights organizations, including a quote from the director of Human Rights Watch. Fox News (Right) reported the sanctions “will prevent a slippery slope of U.S. military and government officials facing prosecution from a nebulous judicial bureaucracy in the Netherlands, argue critics of the global criminal body.” BBC News (Center) highlighted international reactions to the sanctions from ICC member nations, reporting that 79 countries signed a joint statement against the sanctions.

The Details: Trump and Netanyahu spoke about developments with the ceasefire agreement and future plans for the Gaza Strip. Mediators for the U.S. and Israel expect to enter phase two of the ceasefire agreement on March 1, including a Palestinian governing body, withdrawal of Israeli troops, and Hamas releasing Israeli hostages. 
Key Quotes: Trump announced intentions of U.S. ownership, saying, “The US will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job – whether we’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out.” Suggesting relocation for Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, Trump said, “It’s all death. If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people, permanently, in nice homes where they can be happy and not be shot and not be killed and not be knifed to death like what’s happening in Gaza.”
How the Media Covered It: Associated Press (Left bias) called Trump’s plan an “audacious proposal” and highlighted the disapproval from Egypt, Jordan, and other countries in the region. Fox News (Lean Right) suggested this move “would likely bring stability to the Middle East.” The Hill (Center) reported on Trump’s statements throughout the press conference and contextualized these developments with Congress’s recent decision to hold an arms sale for Israel.","['World', 'Donald Trump', 'Benjamin Netanyahu', 'Israel', 'Palestine', 'Ceasefire']","5 takeaways from the Trump, Netanyahu joint presser",The Hill,"President Trump on Tuesday doubled down on his proposal for Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip and announced that the U.S. will take over the tiny territory in a joint press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The Details: White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Friday Trump’s plans to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. Starting Saturday, the U.S. will implement 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, and 10% tariffs on imports from China. 
Key Quote: Leavitt said the new tax on imported goods is “for the illegal fentanyl that they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country.”
Leaders’ Response: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum have vowed to retaliate.

The Details: White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Friday Trump’s plans to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. Starting Saturday, the U.S. will implement 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, and 10% tariffs on imports from China. 
Key Quote: Leavitt said the new tax on imported goods is “for the illegal fentanyl that they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country.”
Leaders’ Response: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum have vowed to retaliate. Trudeau has stated that Canada will be prepared for a ""purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate"" response if the U.S. imposes tariffs on Canadian imports. Sheinbaum has also suggested that Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own.
For Context: During his 2024 presidential campaign, one of Donald Trump's talking points was tackling inflation and imposing tariffs ranging from 10% to 25% on imported goods from other countries.

The Details: President Donald Trump is prioritizing deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed crimes in the U.S. and/or are believed to be threats. Arrests at formerly “protected areas” have been permitted, and deportation flights began days after Trump was sworn in. Trump has postulated that deportations would keep more money within the U.S., supporting the American working class.
Opposition: Some on the left voice concerns about the economic impact of mass deportations. Opinion writers for Politico (Lean Left bias) speculated, for example, that deporting unauthorized farmworkers – who occupy about 40% of their industry – would force the Trump administration “to provide more visas to keep food flowing to stores.” They further argued, “American-born workers will continue to be undercut by a captive, lower-wage workforce — and foreign-born workers will continue to be mistreated.” Opinion writers for The Christian Science Monitor (Center) similarly stated, “Expelling unauthorized immigrants while putting up barriers to new arrivals [has] long-term implications for the country’s aging labor force.” 
Support: The Monitor writers also highlighted common ground on immigration, such as widespread support for deporting unauthorized immigrants with criminal records. A group of Quakers is suing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) based on the belief “that the presence of worshippers from different backgrounds is integral to hearing messages from God.” An opinion writer for The Blaze (Right) suggested the stance twists Christian Scripture: “We are not morally obligated to allow our daughters to be assaulted and raped by illegal aliens.” The writer emphasized Catholic teachings to welcome refugees to an extent: “The Church says that immigrants should not violate the law by coming across the border illegally...

The Details: President Trump’s newly-approved CIA Director John Ratcliffe ordered the declassification and release of a report completed by the CIA during President Joe Biden’s administration and is not the result of new findings. The CIA’s report expresses “low confidence” in the findings.
For Context: Several government agencies like the FBI and Department of Energy have previously said they believe COVID’s most likely origin was a lab. The CIA had not taken an official stance until Ratcliffe declassified this report. In an interview with Breitbart (Right bias), published on January 24, Ratcliffe said one of his “day one” priorities was to look into the CIA’s findings on the matter and get the agency “off the sidelines.” A day after the CIA published its stance, China said it was “extremely unlikely” the virus came from a lab.
How The Media Covered It: ZeroHedge (Lean Right) opened its coverage by highlighting that in January 2020 it was banned from Twitter, Facebook, and Google for suggesting COVID could have leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China. Associated Press (Left) emphasized the CIA’s “low confidence” in its headline and body.

Musk is now in an advisory position to the president, OpenAI joined the Trump-backed AI infrastructure project Stargate, and TikTok remained online in the U.S., following a federal ban. Cook and Zuckerberg have also criticized the European Union's data privacy and competition laws, and Trump publically agreed with them that the E.U. should not fine U.S. tech companies. The Verge said the tech CEO's were ""kissing the ring.""
From the Right: Fox News (Right) covered investor Joe Lonsdale's remarks that he doesn't trust tech leaders as far as he can “throw them” and people should wait and see if the leaders are willing to fight courageously against bad ideas. He continued that it would be interesting to see if the leaders continue to embrace Trump in his second term.

The Details: The prisoners, 69 women and 21 children, returned a day after the Israeli hostages were released. Israel is expected to send 30-50 Palestinians back in exchange for every freed hostage.
Prisoners or Hostages?: Al Jazeera (Lean Left bias) prominently noted that “most” of the prisoners “were detained without charges.” The Daily Mail (Right) wrote that “none the first batch were convicted of major crimes” and “some had been held in ‘administrative detention’, a form of prison without trial.” Euronews (Center) said, “Israel detained them for what it said were offenses related to national security, from throwing stones to more serious accusations like attempted murder.”

There’s no food, no sweets, no salt.” The Daily Mail prominently wrote that Palestinians welcoming the prisoners waved “Hamas and Islamic Jihad flags,” despite the Israeli government warning they could be detained for doing so.

Ramaswamy met with Gov. Mike DeWine (R-OH) regarding the vacant Senate seat left by Vice President J.D. Vance but was passed over as DeWine appointed his Lt. Gov. Jon Husted. The appointment may have accelerated Ramaswamy's plans for a gubernatorial run. Politico (Lean Left) reported “Some in Trump’s world see Ramaswamy’s nascent gubernatorial campaign as a way to clear a path for Musk to do his own work at the agency without him,” citing a source that said, “Elon basically runs the show.”
For Context: ""The breakdown of labor between Musk and Ramaswamy, according to one person familiar, was that Musk focused on the big picture while Ramaswamy focused on deregulation; the rest of the staff will focus on implementation,"" Politico added. 
How The Media Covered It: Some outlets reported on the tension within DOGE, while others only noted Ramaswamy's intent to run for governor. The Daily Mail (Right) and The New Republic (Left) led their pieces with the complaints about Ramaswamy. CBS News, Politico, and Democracy Now! (Left) included them after mentioning Ramaswamy's intent to run for governor.

The Details: Trump said on Saturday, January 18 that he would “most likely” give TikTok 90 days to work out a deal that would allow it to avoid a U.S. ban. On Sunday, TikTok restored services and said in a statement, “We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties (for hosting) TikTok” and that it “will work with President Trump on a long-term solution.”

Trump said on Sunday that he aims to find a situation where the U.S. would have 50% ownership of TikTok. TikTok had taken its case through the U.S. court system, but on Friday, January 17, the Supreme Court upheld the ban.

Biden’s Statement: In his statement, Biden urged updates to outdated sentencing disparities through the Fair Sentencing Act, a federal law aimed at reducing sentences for crack cocaine offenses. 
For Context: Last month, Biden commuted about 1,500 sentences, including 37 people on death row, and issued pardons for 39 people. His recent clemency actions came after nearly two dozen congressional Democrats pushed him to commute sentences of people affected by sentencing disparities. Justice Department data shows that incoming President Donald Trump issued 144 pardons during his first term, compared to President Barack Obama, who issued 212 pardons over two terms. Biden could take more clemency action before he leaves office Monday.
How The Media Covered It: Sources across the spectrum highlighted how the Fair Sentencing Act aimed to reduce sentencing for certain drug offenses.

The Suit: The DOJ’s complaint claims electing council members citywide instead of by district “results in Hispanic citizens not having an equal opportunity to participate in the political process.” The suit also says, “Spanish speakers who are limited-English-proficient, continue to suffer from the effects of discrimination” in Hazleton and that “white voters in Hazleton cast their ballots sufficiently as a bloc to defeat every Hispanic-preferred Hispanic candidate.” The DOJ argues the city is violating the federal Voting Rights Act and wants it to develop a new voting system.
Demographics and Voting History: Hazleton is 63% Hispanic according to the 2020 census, up from around 5% in 2000. In 2016, Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in Hazelton by 5%, and in 2024, he defeated Kamala Harris by 25%.

The Data: The percentage of kindergarteners nationally who received the measles vaccine fell from 95% in 2019 to 93% in 2024, with polio and whooping cough vaccines following similar downward trends, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
For Context: These percentages vary from state to state, though vaccine exemptions rose in both blue and red states. Some infectious disease experts are concerned at how this decline threatens “herd immunity,” which requires 92% of the population to be inoculated. Lower vaccination rates could pose a risk for new outbreaks of these mostly-eradicated diseases. Incoming President Trump’s pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is often described as a vaccine skeptic; in a recent interview, Kennedy said vaccines were “not going to be taken away from anybody,” but stressed a purported need to focus on “huge deficits” with vaccine safety.
How News Outlets Covered It: The New York Times (Lean Left bias) suggested the “Trump administration could encourage anti-vaccine sentiment and undermine state programs.” The Times featured a graph that exaggerated the declining rates by truncating the y-axis of the graph at 91%, which is still a high vaccination rate. In statistics, any graph that doesn't begin at 0% on the y-axis can be considered misleading. As of this writing, no outlets rated Lean Right or Right reported on the news. 
A Different Take: Writing for UnHerd (Center), columnist Karol Markowicz (Right) framed the issue as less about partisanship and more about a lack of public trust in health authorities. “Authorities in red states might be making it easier to obtain the exemptions,” Markowitz wrote. “Or it could be that the great migration of the Covid era has reshuffled people into regions that more closely match their opinion on the issue of vaccinations… The bottom line, though, is that these and other factors wouldn’t be as significantly in play but for the breakdown in trust between many families and health agencies.”","['Public Health', 'Family And Marriage', 'Vaccines', 'Vaccine Skepticism', 'Robert F Kennedy Jr', 'CDC']",Childhood Vaccination Rates Were Falling Even Before the Rise of R.F.K.

Budget Went Up? The Los Angeles Daily News (Center) said the cut is a myth, citing a city councilman's office: ""$76 million – intended to pay for fire department personnel – was placed in a fund separate from the fire department’s regular account when the budget was adopted because contract negotiations with department employees were still taking place at the time.

Mayor Karen Bass cut the city fire department's budget by roughly $17 million is fueling misleading reports.
Budget Was Cut? CNN (Lean Left bias), Fox News (Right), and others reported that Bass cut the LAFD budget and framed it as a key reason for the city's lack of fire preparedness.
Budget Went Up? The Los Angeles Daily News (Center) said the cut is a myth, citing a city councilman's office: ""$76 million – intended to pay for fire department personnel – was placed in a fund separate from the fire department’s regular account when the budget was adopted because contract negotiations with department employees were still taking place at the time. As a result, if you just compare the LAFD’s budget last year to this year’s, it looks like it went down $23M. But that’s because when the budget was adopted last May or June, the city was still negotiating those new contracts.""
Disputing the Councilman: Conversely, The Intercept (Left) reported that those funds “are not linked to increased staffing” and “have not yet been distributed.” A spokesperson for the city controller told The Intercept “the LAFD budget cuts last June included a reduction in sworn payroll, reduced funds for operating supplies, and the elimination of 58 positions.”
The Verdict: With the separate $76 million agreement, the fiscal year budget went up, but fire prevention capacity was apparently harmed by position cuts and overtime hours reductions. Many sources across the political spectrum are failing to explain this nuance.

The cut was the second-largest in Bass’ 2024-25 fiscal budget, city figures show — and it wasn’t even the gutting she wanted.
If she’d had it her way, the LAFD budget would have been slashed by $23 million.",right

The Case: A bipartisan law, signed in April 2024 by President Joe Biden, will ban TikTok in America on January 19th unless its Chinese parent company ByteDance sells the video platform to a U.S. company. On Friday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the company's petition for the court to pause the ban.
The Arguments: ByteDance counsel Noel Francisco argued the ban would suppress the constitutional speech of its American users, and Congress could have addressed concerns with a less heavy-handed measure.

The Details: Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis commissioned the grand jury in 2022 to investigate companies involved with the development and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. Its report, released Tuesday, found no factual evidence that could sustain a criminal indictment, but criticized organizations it said lacked transparency and promoted or mandated vaccines indiscriminately to demographics for which the vaccine's potential harms may have outweighed its benefits.
How the Media Covered It: Tallahassee Democrat (Center bias) included the full report at the bottom of its article and went into detail on its recommended changes to government policy and business practices. Media coverage outside of Florida was sparse. The Federalist (Right) used sensationalism to emphasize the report's negative ""bombshell findings"" and accused government officials of promoting ""pseudo-science"" to push COVID measures. Associated Press (Left) noted DeSantis was planning to run for president when he convened the jury, implying it was a political move he may not have been committed to after losing the primary. It cited ""federal officials and public health experts"" to assert that vaccines ""have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects."" AP brought some balance to its story by noting the jury's criticisms of vaccine development.
Why the Difference: Conservatives tend to be hesitant about COVID-19 vaccines, while liberals are more likely to advocate for vaccination as a crucial safety measure. Though Donald Trump began the rapid vaccine development program known as Operation Warp Speed as president, vaccine attitudes became a major partisan divide in the years after he left office.","['Coronavirus', 'Public Health', 'Criminal Justice', 'Florida', 'Ron DeSantis', 'Coronavirus Vaccine']",Florida grand jury investigating COVID-19 vaccines finds no evidence of criminal activity,Associated Press,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — A statewide grand jury convened at the request of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to investigate “any and all wrongdoing” concerning COVID-19 vaccines did not find any evidence of criminal activity, according to a report unsealed on Tuesday.
“(N)ot finding any indictable criminal activity does not mean we did not find any problems. On the contrary, there are profound and serious issues involving the process of vaccine development and safety surveillance in the United States,” the grand jury wrote in its final report.",left

The Details: JPMorgan's departure follows  Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo all leaving within the past month. The total assets of NZBA member banks went from $74 trillion in November to $61 trillion on January 8th, a decrease of 17.6%.

A 2014 inquiry commissioned by Rotherham, a city of 110,000, found 1,400 girls had been raped in the city.

From the Right: Dominic Green, writing for The Free Press (Lean Right bias), claimed “few in power cared” about the rapes over past decades, but that it changed when “Elon Musk started tweeting.” He wrote, “The scandal is already reshaping British politics… every level of the British system is implicated in the cover-up.”
From the Left: Mark Landler of The New York Times (Lean Left bias), who on January 3 wrote that “Elon Musk has a strange fixation with trolling Britain,” highlighted British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s apparent response to Musk’s interest in the matter. Starmer didn’t mention Musk by name, but said “Those who are spreading lies and misinformation, as far and as wide as possible, are not interested in victims.”

The Details: Incoming President Donald Trump has promised to reverse the ban “immediately,” though media across the spectrum have noted that doing so would not be simple. Biden issued the order under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (OCSLA), which allows the president to withdraw areas from oil and gas drilling. 
Key Quotes: Biden said in a statement, “My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses, and beachgoers have known for a long time: that drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation’s energy needs.” Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said, “This is a disgraceful decision designed to exact political revenge on the American people who gave President Trump a mandate to increase drilling and lower gas prices.”

Murthy has been the Surgeon General since 2014, previously working under both the Obama and Trump administrations.

Livelsberger, 37, was identified by law enforcement sources as the bomber in Wednesday's attack, which left seven wounded. The electric vehicle exploded about 15 seconds after the driver pulled up in front of the hotel's entrance.

The explosion occurred at 8:39 a.m., injuring seven.
Livelsberger: Livelsberger was an active-duty Green Beret from Colorado Springs who was on approved leave from service in Germany. Livelsberger died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound before the explosion. A handgun and rifle, both purchased legally on Monday, were found at his feet in the Cybertruck. Livelsberger and his wife had been separated since around Christmas after a dispute regarding allegations of infidelity. The Denver Gazette (Center bias) reported that he reached out to several ex-girlfriends ahead of the attack. 
Connected to the NOLA Attack?: At the time of this writing, authorities have not found any link between the two attacks, but President Biden instructed them to keep looking. While there aren't indications that Livelsberger and Shamsud-Din Jabbar, the New Orleans attack suspect, knew each other, they both served in Afghanistan in 2009 and at Fort Liberty. They did not serve in the same unit or same years at Fort Liberty, formerly Fort Bragg. Both rented the cars used for their attacks through the Turo app. 
How the Media Covered It: While the Daily Mail (Right bias) mentioned Livelsberger's ex-wife's anti-Trump posts, Salon (Left bias) highlighted his family members' testimonies that he “loved Trump.” Although family members described him as a Trump supporter, the Las Vegas Review-Journal (Center bias) reported he was registered as a “No Labels” voter, a centrist party representing those who feel politically homeless.

In the days before the explosion and apparent suicide, Matthew Livelsberger’s texts to her were playful, almost like a kid with a new toy. 
“I rented a Tesla Cybertruck. It’s the s***,” he wrote her at 9 a.m. on Sunday from Denver. He continued to text her until New Year’s Eve, sending photos and music videos of the vehicle. ",center

From the Left: An analysis from Ana Swanson of The New York Times (Lean Left bias) warned that Chinese companies have found ways around U.S. tariffs in the past and could again. Swanson explained that “Chinese companies have found footholds abroad that allow them to bypass trade barriers with the United States,” citing operations companies have moved to Southeast Asian or African nations that enjoy better trade relations with the U.S. 
From the Center: An opinion published by the Chinese publication South China Morning Post (Center bias) described Trump’s tariff threats on China as “more dangerous than he thinks,” citing China’s recent hardening stance against the U.S. and strengthening of its allies globally. A December 17 analysis from Foreign Affairs (Center bias) highlighted that China’s share of the global GDP is shrinking and that its domestic consumption is not enough for its production, meaning it relies on exports for economic growth.
From the Right: AllSides did not find recent original analysis from the right, though outlets like Townhall (Right bias) and Newsmax (Right bias) authored original coverage that highlighted a December 29 analysis from The Wall Street Journal (Center bias) which suggested Chinese efforts to counter Trump’s tariffs could backfire. The Journal prominently argued that “the big danger is that taking shots at Western companies and restricting exports of critical minerals and other essentials” as it would encourage the U.S. and Western partners to disintegrate their economies from China’s.","['Trade', 'Donald Trump', 'China', 'World', 'Trade War', 'Tariffs', 'Economy And Jobs', 'Business', 'Asia', 'Politics']","China's Efforts to Counter U.S. Tariffs Could Boomerang, Analysts Say",Newsmax (News),"Although China can inflict pain on the United States with the economic tools at its disposal if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on his promise to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese imports, using those tools too aggressively risks backfiring on Beijing, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.

Peace Efforts: Some outlets from the left like The Nation (Left bias) and Washington Post (Lean Left bias) highlighted Carter’s efforts to bring peace to the world after he exited the White House. Middle East Eye (Left bias), which notably has a pro-Palestinian bias, recounted Carter’s efforts to bring peace to the region during his presidency. Middle East Eye described Carter as the “driving force behind the Camp David Accords, which eventually led to the Israel-Egypt peace treaty,” but also called the 1979 Tehran hostage crisis “perhaps the lowest moment of his presidency.”
‘Sunday School’ President: In an opinion for UnHerd (Center bias), Adam Smith described Carter as having earnest ambitions and acting generally in good faith while president, but framed his goodwill efforts as largely ineffective due to the abrasive nature of politics.

Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Choi Sang-mok, will now serve as the country’s interim president. “The most important thing right now is to minimize the confusion in state affairs,” he said after taking up his appointment. 
For Context: Yoon’s impeachment followed his controversial declaration of martial law. Han’s impeachment is likely due to his refusal to appoint judges to fill the Constitutional Court and vote on Yoon’s removal. He claimed his refusal was due to ongoing disagreements that an acting president has the power to do so. There is also disagreement as to whether an overall majority or two-thirds majority is needed to remove an acting president. 
How the Media Covered It: Media outlets across the spectrum covered both the political and economic implications of the recent impeachments, highlighting both criticisms and support; though, it is important to note that South Korea's ideological spectrum differs from that of the U.S. Some outlets also highlighted that now-Acting President Choi was against the most recent impeachment.

The Details: The Social Security Fairness Act aims to eliminate two formulas that reduced benefits for workers who received foreign and government pensions in addition to Social Security. This change could increase payments up to $550 a month, retroactive to December 2023. Critics argue that by potentially costing $196 billion over the next decade, the law might hasten Social Security's insolvency, which is currently projected to hit in the next 10 to 12 years.

However, three more federal prisoners will still face execution: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who helped carry out the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing; Dylann Roof, who killed nine black members of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015; and Robert Bowers, who in 2018 killed 11 congregants at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue.

The Details: The bill extends the federal budget in its current form until March 14th and provides economic aid for farmers and relief aid for areas recently hit by natural disasters. A provision to suspend the debt ceiling, which President-elect Donald Trump advocated for, was not included.

The government will shut down if no spending bill is passed by Friday.
The Details: After a funding bill passed with bipartisan support on Tuesday, Musk criticized it in a ""flurry of posts and reposts"" on X and called for a new version, as reported by The Hill (Center bias). House Republicans acquiesced after Trump echoed Musk's criticisms. Democrats were not involved in drafting the new bill and signaled opposition ahead of the vote, with Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) responding ""hell no"" to a reporter's question.
How the Bills Compare: The first funding bill was 1,547 pages, with provisions including a crackdown on pharmacy benefit managers, restrictions on financing Chinese technology, and the transfer of a football stadium's ownership to the D.C. municipal government. The second bill was 116 pages and reduced to a handful of priorities: funding the government until March 15, suspending the debt ceiling for two years, extending the farm bill, and providing disaster recovery aid.
How the Media Covered It: Yahoo News (Lean Left) observed Trump appeared ""pissed"" at Democrats' insinuation that Musk was more in charge than him.

The Details: The final Selzer/Des Moines Register poll before the 2024 election showed Vice President Harris leading by three points in Iowa. However, Trump won the state with a 13-point lead.

Now, she's publicly admitting she lied.
The Details: In an interview with Kat DePasquale on the ""Let's Talk with Kat"" podcast, Mangum said, “I testified falsely against them by saying that they raped me when they didn’t and that was wrong,” adding, “I made up a story that wasn’t true because I wanted validation from people and not from God.” The interview was conducted from North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women last month and released on Monday. Mangum is in prison after being convicted of the second-degree murder of her ex-boyfriend in 2013.
The Case: Mangum claimed the rape happened when she and another exotic dancer were hired to perform at a party thrown by the lacrosse players on March 13, 2006. The players were arrested, but the case was dismissed in 2007 and the men reached a settlement with the school. There was no DNA evidence to support Mangum's accusations, and the district attorney working the case was disbarred for withholding evidence. 
How the Media Covered It: The New York Post (Lean Right bias) called her a ""former stripper, convicted felon"" in its headline.

The Details: Judge Christopher Lopez said the court-appointed trustee who facilitated the auction didn’t run a transparent process that encouraged competitive bids. The judge rejected Jones’ claim that the action was plagued by illegal collusion.
For Context: Auction proceeds will go to the families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting, which Jones repeatedly claimed was staged.

Key Details: On Sunday, during an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Trump said he ""absolutely"" planned to halt birthright citizenship once in office. He did signal an openness to finding a way for Dreamers, unauthorized immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, to stay in the country. The legislative proposal known as the DREAM Act, which was introduced in 2001, has not become law.
Key Quote: “Do you know if somebody sets a foot — just a foot, one foot, you don’t need two — on our land, ‘Congratulations you are now a citizen of the United States of America,’” Trump told NBC. “Yes, we’re going to end that, because it’s ridiculous.” Eric Ruarck, director of research for NumbersUSA, which seeks to reduce immigration, said, “Simply crossing the border and having a child should not entitle anyone to citizenship.”
For Context: Many legal experts think Trump wouldn't be able to end the right through an executive order since the 14th Amendment grants citizenship to those born in the United States. Proponents say an exception in the amendment can be interpreted to exclude children of unauthorized immigrants.

Key Details: On Sunday, during an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Trump said he ""absolutely"" planned to halt birthright citizenship once in office. He did signal an openness to finding a way for Dreamers, unauthorized immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, to stay in the country. The legislative proposal known as the DREAM Act, which was introduced in 2001, has not become law.
Key Quote: “Do you know if somebody sets a foot — just a foot, one foot, you don’t need two — on our land, ‘Congratulations you are now a citizen of the United States of America,’” Trump told NBC. “Yes, we’re going to end that, because it’s ridiculous.” Eric Ruarck, director of research for NumbersUSA, which seeks to reduce immigration, said, “Simply crossing the border and having a child should not entitle anyone to citizenship.”
For Context: Many legal experts think Trump wouldn't be able to end the right through an executive order since the 14th Amendment grants citizenship to those born in the United States. Proponents say an exception in the amendment can be interpreted to exclude children of unauthorized immigrants.

The Details: Romanian President Klaus Iohannis declassified files from intelligence services that alleged Georgescu received unlawful foreign support. Georgescu won 23% of the vote, and would have run against centrist Elena Lasconi, who won 19%, in the second round runoff.

For Context: Neely boarded the train and began saying he was ready to go to jail and “Someone’s going to die today!” He was unarmed and homeless at the time. Neely died after Penny put him in a chokehold for six minutes, in what Penny claims was self-defense.
The Jury: The jury was instructed to come to a unanimous verdict on the manslaughter charge before considering the lesser charge. The jury told the judge they were deadlocked, following nearly 20 hours of deliberation. If they cannot agree, the case will be declared a mistrial. The defense moved for a mistrial after the deadlock, but the prosecution agreed to put the manslaughter charge aside, hoping the jury can still convict on the criminally negligent homicide. On Friday, the judge told the jury to “Go home and think about something else,” before returning to deliberations on the negligence charge on Monday. The manslaughter charge carried a maximum sentence of 15 years; criminally negligent homicide carries a maximum sentence of four years.
How the Media Covered It: USA Today (Lean Left bias) emphasized that Neely was unarmed and screaming at passengers, and struggled with schizophrenia and drug abuse.

Tennessee's solicitor general, J. Matthew Rice, responded that the law falls within the state's prerogative to regulate youth medicine.
The Justices' Responses: The court's three liberal justices voiced agreement with Prelogar. Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that, under the law, a doctor may prescribe testosterone to a biologically male child to become more masculine, but not a biologically female child for the same reason.

Hours later the parliament voted to lift the martial law declaration.
The Details: Yoon declared martial law in a television address, leading to protests outside of parliament. Both the ruling party and opposition voted to block the president's declaration. The announcement came as disagreements continued to unfold between Yoon's People Power Party and the opposition Democratic Party over the proposed budget for the coming year. Yoon is now facing an impeachment vote. 
Key Quotes: ""I declare martial law to protect the Republic of Korea from the threats of North Korean communist forces, to immediately eradicate the unscrupulous pro-Pyongyang anti-state forces that pillage the freedom and happiness of our people and to protect free constitutional order,” Yoon said, adding that the opposition's move to cut over two billion from the budget was a ploy to paralyze the government.

We cannot let the military rule this country,” opposition leader Lee Jae-myung said. 
For Context: As an emergency measure, martial law implies temporary rule by military authorities during times of crisis when civil authorities are deemed incapable of normal functioning.

For Context: Under the current law, it is illegal to assist someone in dying. Scotland is considering a similar bill on assisted death. Canada passed a law legalizing assisted dying in 2016, and in 2027, Canada will extend eligibility to those whose sole underlying condition is mental illness.

Some point out the British law is strict about those who can be considered.

Key Details: In a statement, President Biden announced broad protection for any crimes his son Hunter ""committed or may have committed"" since January 1, 2014. This comes after a year of the president and his spokespeople saying that he would not pardon Hunter. Members of the Biden family believe that many criticisms of Hunter were meant to cause him to relapse into drug addiction and imperil President Biden's presidency.
Key Quotes: ""No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son — and that is wrong,"" President Biden said in a statement. In a statement from House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY), Comer said, “Not only has he {President Biden} falsely claimed that he never met with his son’s foreign business associates and that his son did nothing wrong, but he also lied when he said he would not pardon Hunter Biden.”
For Context: Hunter was set to face sentencing for tax and gun crimes in December, with the possibility of facing up to 20 years in prison. President Biden has argued that the indictment was politically charged.
How the Media Covered it: CNN (Lean Left bias) reported that the pardon intensified the ""entanglement of politics and the rule of law"" and predicted that this entanglement would worsen during President-elect Donald Trump's second term. The Washington Examiner (Lean Right bias) reported that the Department of Justice sat on evidence that Hunter Biden may have violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act during his international business dealings.","['Joe Biden', 'Pardons', 'Hunter Biden', 'Justice']","Why Biden pardoned Hunter: Guilty feelings, family solidarity",Axios,"President Biden has privately expressed guilt for years about the investigations and convictions of his son Hunter. Late Sunday night, he tried to lighten that guilt by giving him a broad pardon.
Why it matters: Biden's pardon marks the end of a central drama of his presidency that has both weighed him down and propelled him forward.
